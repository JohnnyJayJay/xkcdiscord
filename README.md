xkcdiscord is a tiny Discord app that can look up and display xkcd comics.

## Usage

Most commands should be sufficiently documented through their description. Quick overview:

- `/xkcd show` - show the latest xkcd or a specific xkcd by number
- `/xkcd rand` - show random xkcd
- `/xkcd search` - Search for an xkcd by title

Setting the `plain` option to true on any command will make the bot only share the comic picture and not embed it with a title, number and date.
